# Sentiment-Analysis-Model
This repository depicts my attempt at creating a sentiment analysis model using the random forest (RF) and logistic regression algorithms. The repository includes an 'About.pdf' document and a google colab python file.
The 'About.pdf' document details the dataset, how it was preprocessed, trained and tested. It also gives more insight on the python code.
